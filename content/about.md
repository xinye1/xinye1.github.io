I'm onto a [few things](https://github.com/xinye1) these days. All is very exciting (for someone who has always been playing on the edge of programming, _proper_ data science, with a slice of Raspberry Pi leftover somewhere), but I think it's time for me to actually focus and get a few concrete things done that's actually of some value to the community.

With a degree in Physics and another one in Economics, having a data science career means learning will always be the theme, with all the job changes as evidence. While I'm semi-proud of what I have learned so far I think I can learn so much faster and better, which is by the way of sharing what I have learned.

And that is what this blog is about - I'd be very surprised and humbled by anyone who would actually spend time reading any of the content, but I shall enjoy my learning.
